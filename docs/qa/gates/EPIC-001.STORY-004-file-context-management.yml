  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'UTF-8 encoding, local file operations only, no injection risks. Minor recommendation: add path traversal validation (non-blocking).'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'All operations well under requirements. Average 49ms vs 100ms target. Performance validated via test execution.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Graceful error handling, missing files reported without exceptions, atomic file operations'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code clarity, comprehensive docstrings, full type hints, well-organized tests'
